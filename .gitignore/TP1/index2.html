	<p><SPAN style="color: red">Valentino Rossi (born 16 February 1979) </span>is an Italian professional motorcycle racer and multiple MotoGP World Champion. He is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time, with nine Grand Prix World Championships to his name – seven of which are in the premier class.
Following his father, Graziano Rossi, Valentino started racing in Grand Prix in 1996 for Aprilia in the 125cc category and won his first World Championship the following year. From there, he moved up to the 250cc category with Aprilia and won the 250cc World Championship in 1999. 
After graduating to the premier class in 2000, he won the 500cc World Championship with Honda in 2001, the MotoGP World Championships (also with Honda) in 2002 and 2003, and continued his streak of back-to-back championships by winning the 2004 and 2005 titles after leaving Honda to 
join Yamaha, before regaining the title in 2008 and retaining it in 2009. He left Yamaha to join Ducati for the 2011 season, but it was confirmed in 2012 that he would rejoin Yamaha for the 2013 and 2014 seasons.
Rossi came close to winning the 2015 title after several years out of contention, leading the championship for most of the season, only to lose out in the final round to fellow Yamaha rider Jorge Lorenzo. The end of that season was marred with controversy following Rossi having a 
coming together on track with Marc Márquez resulting in a grid penalty for the final round, as well as accusing Márquez of deliberately trying to harm his championship, something Márquez repeatedly denied. Feedback from riders and experts showed a generalized consensus that 
Márquez's manoeuvres were within the rules, although unsportsmanlike - with Race Director Mike Webb officially acknowledging that there was blame on both sides. Marquez's manoeuvres, however, exasperated Rossi, prompting an illegal response.
Rossi is first in all time 500 cc/MotoGP race wins standings, with 86 victories, and second in all time overall wins standings with 112 race wins, behind Giacomo Agostini with 122.</p>
